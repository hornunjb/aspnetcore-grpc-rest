# Hybrid RESTful and gRPC service with ASP.NET Core 5.0

This document outlines how to get started with a hybrid REST and gRPC service using ASP.NET Core 5.0.

## Motivation

While looking at migrating existing APIs from REST to gRPC, I struggled to find a working C# example, where I could run a hybrid between the two. I did not want to convert an existing service strictly to gRPC and throw away the REST implementation since legacy services may still depend on it. Instead I wondered if it would be possible to add the gRPC component on top of an existing REST service and expose separate ports to run HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2 connections. For a relatively simple idea, I had hoped there would be various documentation for how to achieve this, but after a bit of researching, I decided to create my own example.

## Build and Run the Sample

You can import the code straight into your preferred IDE (i.e. Visual Studio) or run the sample using the following commands (in the root project folder).

```pwsh
>  dotnet restore
>  dotnet build
>  dotnet .\aspnetapp\bin\Debug\net5.0\aspnetapp.dll
```

After the application runs, navigate to http://localhost:4999/swagger/index.html in your web browser to access the Swagger UI. Enter a value in the name field and it should return something similar like this below:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello Ben"
}
```

For the gRPC piece, you can install a gRPC client (i.e. [BloomRPC](https://github.com/uw-labs/bloomrpc)). Import the `greet.proto` file to the client and connect to `localhost:5000`.

## Build and run the sample with Docker

You can build and run the sample in Docker using the following commands. Navigate to the folder where the Dockerfile lies.

```pwsh
>  docker build -t aspnetapp-k8s .
>  docker run -it --rm -p 9000:4999 -p 9001:5000 --name aspnetcore-sample aspnetapp-k8s
```

After the application starts, navigate to `http://localhost:9000/swagger` in your web browser.

> Note: The run command `-p` argument maps ports 9000 and 9001 on the local machine to ports 4999 and 5000 in the container (the form of the port mapping is `host:container`).

## Build and run the sample with Minikube

If you want to run Kubernetes locally, you can spin up a whole cluster manually. Another solution is to use [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/). 

You can build and run the sample locally with [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/). This document won't show you how to install [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/) or the command line tool [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

If this is your first time setting up `minikube`, the Docker daemon in `minikube` may not initally know about the Docker daemon in your host. You can share the context by running the following commmands:
```pwsh
>  minikube docker-env
>  SET DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
>  SET DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.13.216:2376
>  SET DOCKER_CERT_PATH=C:\Users\[USERNAME]\.minikube\certs
>  REM Run this command to configure your shell:
>  REM @FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('minikube docker-env') DO @%i
```

`minikube` also provides a port range between 30000–32767 for services, so when a new service gets created a random port gets choosen. You can specify the nodePort range by running a similar command like this one below:
```pwsh
>  minikube start --extra-config=apiserver.service-node-port-range=80-30000
```

> Note: To stop the local `minikube` cluster, run the command: `minikube stop`

Next, build the docker image:
```pwsh
>  docker build -t aspnetapp-k8s .
```

Create a service and a deployment:
```pwsh
>  cd aspnetapp
>  kubectl create -f service.yaml
>  kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
```

> Note: To delete a service and deployment, you can run the following commands: `kubectl delete service aspnetapp-k8s` and `kubectl delete deployment aspnetapp-k8s`.

Now check if the deployment succeeded:
```pwsh
>  kubectl get deployments
```

You can also check the statuses of your pods:
```pwsh
>  kubectl get pods
```

To find out which IP and ports have been exposed, use this command (this is different when using managed k8s):
```pwsh
>  minikube service aspnetapp-k8s --url
```

You'll get an output similar to this:
```pwsh
http://192.168.99.100:4999
http://192.168.99.100:5000
```

Navigate to `http://192.168.99.100:4999/swagger` in your web browser to test the REST component.

And again for the gRPC piece, you can use a gRPC client (i.e. [BloomRPC](https://github.com/uw-labs/bloomrpc) to connect to `http://192.168.99.100:5000`).
